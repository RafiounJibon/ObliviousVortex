<p>
This project challenged us to make our own design by using the programming language, Python. I used my creativity to develop my design as well as what I learned. I presented my knowledge of the for loop, making functions that call other functions, and using the RGB spectrum to implement gradient colors. This project helped me expand my learning of programming in a whole.
